    <h1>Code</h1>

    <p>
      I graduated from NYU with an undergraduate degree in game design, but
      currently work as a developer in the University of Pennsylvania Libraries.
      More specifically, I'm a Cultural Heritage Programmer for the Schoenberg
      Institute for Manuscript Studies.

    <p>
      In the broadest terms possible, I develop web tools to aid manuscript
      scholars in their research.
